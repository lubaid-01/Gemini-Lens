3. Set Up a Virtual EnvironmentIt's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.Windows:python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
macOS / Linux:python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
4. Install DependenciesInstall the required Python libraries from the requirements.txt file.pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can create one with the following content or install the packages manually.)requirements.txt:PyQt6
Pillow
google-generativeai
python-dotenv
Manual Installation:pip install PyQt6 Pillow google-generativeai python-dotenv
5. Configure Your API KeyCreate a file named .env in the root directory of the project.Add your Google AI API key to this file:GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Your Python script (gemini.py) should be updated to load this key.‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to UseOnce the setup is complete, run the main application script from your terminal:python main.py
Left-click and drag to draw on the screen.Right-click to open the menu.Clear: Erase all drawings.Minimize: Hide the application window.ask: Send a text-only prompt to the AI.ask with screen: Capture the screen and send it with a prompt to the AI.Quit: Close the application.üìÑ LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
